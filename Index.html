    <h2> About Earth</h2>
    <p>It is a common misconception<br> that “Terra” is the internationally-recognized scientific name of the planet, but in reality Earth does not have an official international name. The standard English name of the planet, including in science, is “Earth”.</p>
    <p>Earth is not flat, but it's not perfectly round either. ...
        The days are getting longer. ...
        There weren't always several continents. ...
        Earth's icy times. ...
        The driest place on Earth. ...
        Earth's gravity isn't uniform. ...
        In the past, sea levels were very different. ...
        Our sun has a voracious appetite.</p>
