                <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>
                <p>Last updated: April, 2023</p>
                <p>Thank you for using the Kutty mobile application (the "App") operated by Smart Minds Team Solutions ("us", "we", or "our"). Please read our Return and Refund Policy carefully before making any purchases within the App.</p>
                <h2>Credit Purchases</h2>
                <p>By purchasing credits within the App, you agree to use them to access and use the services available in the App. The credits you purchase are non-refundable and non-transferable.</p>
                <h2>No Refunds</h2>
                <p>All credit purchases made within the App are final and non-refundable. We do not provide refunds or exchanges for any unused or partially used credits, as these credits do not have an expiration date and can be used for future access to the App's services.</p>
                <h2>No Credit-to-Cash Conversions</h2>
                <p>Credits purchased within the App have no cash value and cannot be converted, redeemed, or exchanged for cash or any other form of monetary value. Credits are intended solely for use within the App to access and use the available services.</p>
                <h2>Cancellation of Subscription</h2>
                <p>If you have subscribed to a recurring subscription plan and decide to cancel, you may do so through your online account management page or by contacting our customer support team. The cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing cycle, and you will not be charged for the next billing cycle. However, any unused credits remaining in your account at the time of cancellation will not be refunded.</p>
                <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
                <p>Refunds may be granted at our sole discretion under exceptional circumstances, such as technical issues within the App that prevent you from using the services or accessing the credits you have purchased. If you believe you qualify for a refund due to exceptional circumstances, please contact our customer support team with a detailed explanation of the issue.</p>
                <h2>Contact Us</h2>
                <p>If you have any questions or concerns about our Return and Refund Policy, please feel free to contact us at support@kuttyai.com.</p>
